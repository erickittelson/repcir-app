# Repcir Brand Guidelines
## Accountability Fitness App | Brand Strategy Package

---

## 1. Brand Positioning Statement

**For anyone serious enough to let their circle hold them accountable**, Repcir is the accountability fitness app **that transforms your crew into a high-performance unit**. Unlike casual fitness apps that reward participation trophies and streaks of mediocrity, **Repcir is built on the principle that effort is the standard**—creating a space where effort is the only currency, accountability is mutual, and excellence is the standard.

**We exist for those who understand:** results are earned, not given.

---

## 2. Tagline Options

### Primary Recommendation
> **"Earn Your Circle"**

### Alternative Options

| Tagline | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **"Effort Is The Standard"** | Direct brand philosophy statement; bold and filtering |
| **"Built Different. Together."** | Emphasizes collective excellence without softness |
| **"Your Pack. Your Standard."** | Military/wolf pack energy; ownership of expectations |
| **"No Passengers"** | Anti-entitlement; everyone contributes or exits |
| **"The Table Isn't Free"** | Visceral reminder that good things are earned |

### Usage Guidelines
- **"Earn Your Circle"** — Primary marketing, app store, hero messaging
- **"Effort Is The Standard"** — Internal culture, merchandise, community rallying cry
- **"No Passengers"** — Accountability features, workout challenges

---

## 3. Brand Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Brand Personality Traits

| Trait | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Commanding** | We speak with authority earned through standards, not volume |
| **Direct** | No fluff, no coddling, no participation trophies |
| **Warm (earned)** | Respect and camaraderie for those who show up |
| **Aspirational** | We believe you can be more—and we'll hold you to it |
| **Anti-fragile** | Discomfort is the point; struggle is the feature |

### Voice Characteristics

**We are:**
- A drill sergeant who genuinely wants you to succeed
- The friend who tells you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear
- A Roman centurion addressing their cohort before battle

**We are NOT:**
- A cheerleader with empty enthusiasm
- A disappointed parent guilt-tripping you
- A bro-culture gym screaming "LET'S GOOOO"

### Tone Spectrum

```
SOFT ←————————————————[REPCIR]——————→ AGGRESSIVE
                           ↑
                    Firm but not harsh
                    Demanding but not demeaning
                    Premium but not pretentious
```

### Do / Don't Examples

#### Celebrating Achievement

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Earned. Your cohort sees you." | "OMG amazing job!! You're crushing it! 🎉🔥" |
| "The work was done. Respect." | "Way to go, superstar!" |
| "Your circle is stronger because of today." | "You're basically a superhero now!" |

#### Encouraging After Missed Workout

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Your cohort trained today. Tomorrow?" | "No worries! Rest days are important too! 💕" |
| "The gap widens or closes. Your call." | "Don't be so hard on yourself!" |
| "They showed up. Will you?" | "Missing one day won't hurt! You deserve a break!" |

#### Onboarding New Users

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "This isn't for everyone. That's the point." | "Welcome to the #1 fitness app for everyone!" |
| "Your circle will hold you accountable. Ready?" | "Get ready for FUN group workouts!" |
| "Effort is the standard. You're here. Good start." | "You're going to LOVE this journey!" |

#### Push Notifications

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Your cohort is moving. You're not." | "Hey friend! Time for a workout! 😊" |
| "3 of 4 completed today. Don't be the gap." | "Don't forget your daily workout!" |
| "The standard doesn't lower itself." | "You've got this! Believe in yourself!" |

### Writing Principles

1. **Brevity is respect** — Say it in fewer words. Time is earned.
2. **Statements over questions** — We don't ask "Ready to work out?" We state "It's time."
3. **Collective language** — "Your cohort" > "Your circle" > "You"
4. **Earned warmth** — Praise is rare and therefore meaningful
5. **No exclamation inflation** — One exclamation point per month, maximum

## 4. Color Palette

### Primary Colors

| Color | Name | Hex Code | RGB | Usage |
|-------|------|----------|-----|-------|
| ![#1A1A2E](https://via.placeholder.com/20/1A1A2E/1A1A2E) | **Repcir Black** | `#1A1A2E` | 26, 26, 46 | Primary background, headers, authority |
| ![#C9A227](https://via.placeholder.com/20/C9A227/C9A227) | **Earned Gold** | `#C9A227` | 201, 162, 39 | Achievement, premium elements, CTAs |
| ![#F5F5F0](https://via.placeholder.com/20/F5F5F0/F5F5F0) | **Legion White** | `#F5F5F0` | 245, 245, 240 | Text, clean space, contrast |

### Secondary Colors

| Color | Name | Hex Code | RGB | Usage |
|-------|------|----------|-----|-------|
| ![#8B7355](https://via.placeholder.com/20/8B7355/8B7355) | **Bronze Effort** | `#8B7355` | 139, 115, 85 | Secondary achievements, progress |
| ![#2D3436](https://via.placeholder.com/20/2D3436/2D3436) | **Forge Gray** | `#2D3436` | 45, 52, 54 | UI elements, secondary text |
| ![#6B0F1A](https://via.placeholder.com/20/6B0F1A/6B0F1A) | **Blood Oath** | `#6B0F1A` | 107, 15, 26 | Urgent alerts, accountability prompts |
| ![#1B4332](https://via.placeholder.com/20/1B4332/1B4332) | **Victory Green** | `#1B4332` | 27, 67, 50 | Success states, completion |

### Accent Colors (Sparingly)

| Color | Name | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| ![#D4AF37](https://via.placeholder.com/20/D4AF37/D4AF37) | **Triumph** | `#D4AF37` | Major achievements only |
| ![#E8E4E1](https://via.placeholder.com/20/E8E4E1/E8E4E1) | **Stone** | `#E8E4E1` | Backgrounds, cards |

### Color Rationale

| Choice | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|
| **Deep blacks over pure black** | Sophistication without harshness; premium feel |
| **Gold as earned element** | Gold is the color of achievement across cultures; not given freely |
| **Muted, desaturated palette** | Rejects the "happy fitness app" neon trend; serious tools for serious people |
| **Deep red sparingly** | Blood, sacrifice, commitment—but not aggression |
| **Forest green for success** | Growth, life, achievement—earned through natural effort |

### Color Psychology Alignment

```
Premium ✓       (Deep tones, gold accents)
Earned ✓        (Gold must be unlocked through achievement)
Strong ✓        (Bold contrast, authoritative darks)
Not Aggressive ✓ (Muted saturation, warm undertones)
```

### Color Usage Rules

1. **Gold is earned** — Never use Earned Gold for default states; only for achievements and premium elements
2. **Black is authority** — Use Repcir Black for statements of importance
3. **White space is respect** — Don't crowd the interface; earned minimalism
4. **Red is reserved** — Blood Oath appears only for accountability moments

## 6. Logo Concept Description

### Primary Logo Concept: "The Shield Formation"

**Description:**
A minimalist, geometric mark representing the Roman testudo (shield wall) formation—where individual shields interlock to create an impenetrable unit. The mark consists of overlapping geometric shapes (circles or rounded squares) that connect to form a unified whole.

**Key Visual Elements:**
- 4-6 interlocking shapes representing cohort members
- Negative space creates a subtle "C" for Repcir
- Shapes touch but don't overlap completely (individual strength within unity)
- One shape subtly differentiated (leadership/accountability)

### Alternative Concept: "The Earned Ring"

**Description:**
A single, incomplete circle with a gap—representing that the circle must be actively completed through effort. The gap is intentional: membership is earned, not given.

**Key Visual Elements:**
- Bold, confident stroke weight
- Gap at the top (climbing to complete)
- Interior mark suggesting upward movement
- Clean, single-line execution

### Alternative Concept: "The Roman Numeral"

**Description:**
A stylized arrangement that subtly references Roman numerals, nodding to the Latin/military origin of "Repcir." Abstract enough for modern use, meaningful enough for those who understand.

### Logo Style Guidelines

| Attribute | Direction |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Style** | Minimal, geometric, confident |
| **Complexity** | Simple enough for favicon, memorable at scale |
| **Lines** | Bold strokes, no thin/delicate elements |
| **Curves** | Controlled, intentional (not playful) |
| **Symmetry** | Balanced but not rigid |

### Logo Don'ts

- No literal group silhouettes (too soft)
- No hearts (too casual/emotional)
- No flexing muscles (too aggressive/bro)
- No generic swooshes (too corporate)
- No gradients (too trendy)
- No more than 2 colors in mark

### Wordmark Guidelines

**"REPCIR"** in all caps, Bebas Neue or custom geometric sans-serif

- Letterspacing: Slightly tracked out (+2-5%)
- Optional: Subtle modification to the "O" to echo the icon
- Standalone capability: Wordmark should function without icon

### Logo Lockups

1. **Icon + Wordmark (horizontal)** — Primary usage
2. **Icon + Wordmark (stacked)** — Square applications
3. **Icon only** — App icon, small applications
4. **Wordmark only** — Text-heavy contexts

## 7. Brand Messaging Framework

### Elevator Pitch

**10-Second Version:**

REPCIR

Effort is the standard.

Before you continue:

This works when you're honest.
This works when you commit.
This works when your cohort matters.
