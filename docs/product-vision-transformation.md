# Rallyproof Product Vision: Social Accountability Transformation

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** North Star Document

---

## Executive Summary

Rallyproof is transforming from a content-centered fitness app (workout libraries, pre-built plans, browse workouts) into a **social accountability platform** where fitness happens through human connection, not content consumption.

**The core insight:** People don't fail at fitness because they lack workout content. They fail because they lack accountability. The gym has infinite content. What's missing is someone who notices when you don't show up.

---

## Part 1: Core User Journey

### The New Rallyproof Experience

**Old Rallyproof:** Open app -> Browse workouts -> Pick one -> Maybe do it -> Repeat tomorrow (or not)

**New Rallyproof:** Open app -> See your Circle's activity -> Feel the pull of accountability -> Log your workout -> Get recognized -> Come back tomorrow

### The Daily Loop

```
Morning: Wake up, see who trained yesterday (and who didn't)
         Feel the social pressure to show up today

Workout: Quick log what you did (frictionless, <30 seconds)
         AI Coach generates workout if needed

Evening: See encouragement from Circle
         Unlock achievement if streak continues
         Notice who needs a nudge
```

### The Accountability Flywheel

1. **Join Circle** - You're not alone anymore
2. **Set Public Goal** - Stakes are real when others see
3. **Train & Log** - Your activity shows up in the feed
4. **Get Recognized** - Badges, streaks, Circle love
5. **See Others** - Their training motivates yours
6. **Hold Each Other** - Notice who's slipping, send nudges
7. **Repeat** - The Circle keeps you coming back

---

## Part 2: Primary Features (Ranked by Importance)

### 1. Circles (Accountability Groups) - CORE

**Why #1:** Without Circles, there's no accountability. This is the foundation.

**What a Circle is:**
- 3-15 people who hold each other accountable
- Shared visibility into who's training
- Safe space for vulnerability and support
- NOT a place to browse content

**Circle Features:**
- Activity feed (who trained today, who's on a streak)
- Accountability dashboard (at-a-glance: who's showing up)
- Nudge system (ping someone who's been quiet)
- Weekly summaries ("Your circle averaged 4.2 workouts this week")
- Shared goals (optional group challenges)

**Circle Types:**
- Private (invite-only, default)
- Public (discoverable, join by request)
- System circles (for specific programs - deprecated)

**Key Metrics:**
- Circle activity rate
- Member retention within circles
- Nudge response rate

---

### 2. Activity Feed - CRITICAL

**Why #2:** The feed is where accountability happens. It's the heartbeat of the app.

**What appears in the feed:**
- Completed workouts (with optional detail)
- Streak milestones (3 days, 7 days, 30 days, etc.)
- Goal progress updates
- Personal records
- Achievements earned
- Returned from break ("Back at it after 5 days!")

**Feed Psychology:**
- Seeing others train creates FOMO and motivation
- Seeing others struggle creates connection
- NOT seeing someone creates concern -> nudge
- Celebrating others feels good for both parties

**Feed Rules:**
- Circle-scoped by default (you see your Circle)
- No public "explore" feed (this isn't Instagram)
- No likes (shallow engagement)
- Reactions limited to meaningful ones: fire (crushed it), fist bump (solidarity), heart (support)
- Comments encouraged for genuine connection

**Privacy:**
- Users control what appears in feed
- Can log workout without posting
- Can share to specific circles only

---

### 3. Quick Workout Logging - ESSENTIAL

**Why #3:** If logging is hard, people won't do it. Friction kills habits.

**Target:** Log any workout in under 30 seconds.

**Quick Log Options:**

1. **"Just Log It"** (5 seconds)
   - Tap workout type (strength, cardio, sport, other)
   - Tap duration (15/30/45/60+ min)
   - Optional: add a note
   - Done

2. **AI-Assisted Log** (15 seconds)
   - Voice or text: "Did an hour of legs, squats felt good"
   - AI extracts: Strength, 60 min, lower body, positive mood
   - User confirms
   - Done

3. **Detailed Log** (2-5 min, optional)
   - Full exercise breakdown
   - Sets, reps, weights
   - For tracking PRs and progress

**Post-Log Flow:**
- Celebration animation (brief, not annoying)
- Share to Circle (default on, can toggle)
- Achievement unlock if applicable
- Streak update

**Quick Log UX Principles:**
- Always one tap away from logging
- Persistent FAB (floating action button) on main screens
- "What did you do today?" prompt in evening
- Never require specific exercises to log

---

### 4. AI Coach - HIGH VALUE

**Why #4:** Replaces the need for browsing content. Personalized, on-demand.

**AI Coach Capabilities:**

1. **Generate Workouts On-Demand**
   - "Give me a 30-minute upper body workout"
   - "I have dumbbells and 20 minutes"
   - "Something for when I'm tired but want to move"
   - Knows your equipment, limitations, goals, history

2. **Answer Questions**
   - "Is my progress on track?"
   - "Should I train today or rest?"
   - "How do I fix my squat form?"
   - "Why am I not getting stronger?"

3. **Coaching Modes** (already built)
   - General Coach
   - Mental Blocks (fear, anxiety)
   - Motivation
   - Life Balance
   - Goal Setting
   - Accountability
   - Confidence

4. **Proactive Nudges** (new)
   - "You usually train Mondays. Planning to today?"
   - "3-day streak! Want a workout to keep it going?"
   - "You mentioned your knee is better. Ready to add leg work?"

**AI Coach Philosophy:**
- The coach is always available
- It knows you (your data, history, preferences)
- It doesn't replace your Circle (humans for accountability)
- It replaces browsing (no need to scroll through workouts)

---

### 5. Achievements & Badges - MOTIVATING

**Why #5:** Gamification done right creates lasting motivation.

**Achievement Categories:**

1. **Consistency Badges**
   - Streak milestones (3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, 365 days)
   - Weekly completion (4/week for 4 weeks)
   - Never-miss-Monday (8 consecutive Mondays)
   - Early Bird/Night Owl (time-based patterns)

2. **Progress Badges**
   - First PR
   - PR in each major lift category
   - Goal completed
   - Level up (beginner -> intermediate -> advanced)

3. **Social Badges**
   - Circle founder
   - Accountability partner (sent 10 nudges that got responses)
   - Hype master (100 reactions given)
   - Comeback story (returned after 30+ days)

4. **Challenge Badges**
   - Challenge completed
   - Challenge champion (top performer)
   - Challenge creator

**Badge Display:**
- 3 featured badges on profile
- Full badge collection in profile
- Rare badges highlighted
- Circle-visible achievements

---

### 6. Goals & Milestones - DIRECTION

**Why #6:** Goals give accountability purpose. Without goals, what are you accountable for?

**Goal Types:**

1. **Consistency Goals** (most important for accountability)
   - "Train 4x per week"
   - "Never miss 2 days in a row"
   - "Complete 100 workouts this year"

2. **Progress Goals**
   - "Squat 225 lbs"
   - "Run a 5K in under 25 minutes"
   - "Lose 10 lbs"

3. **Skill Goals**
   - "Get my first pull-up"
   - "Learn back tuck"
   - "Do 10 push-ups"

**Goal Features:**
- Public to Circle (default) - accountability
- AI-generated milestones (already built)
- Progress tracking
- Deadline optional
- Goal completion celebrations

---

### 7. Personal Records - TRACKING

**Why #7:** PRs prove progress. They make training feel meaningful.

**PR Types:**
- Lift PRs (1RM, 3RM, 5RM)
- Cardio PRs (distance, time)
- Skill PRs (first achievement)
- Bodyweight PRs (most reps)

**PR Features:**
- Auto-detected from detailed logs
- Manual entry
- PR history (graph over time)
- Share to Circle
- PR leaderboard within Circle (optional)

---

## Part 3: What to REMOVE or Hide

### Remove Completely

1. **Workout Library/Browse**
   - Old: Scroll through hundreds of workouts
   - New: Ask AI Coach for exactly what you need
   - Rationale: Browsing is procrastination disguised as productivity

2. **Pre-built Programs** (as primary feature)
   - Old: 12-week strength program, 8-week runner program
   - New: AI generates personalized plans on-demand
   - Note: Keep for challenges/group programs, but not discoverable

3. **Workout Discovery Tab**
   - Old: "Discover" tab with trending workouts, popular plans
   - New: No discovery. Your Circle IS your feed.
   - Rationale: We're not a content platform

4. **Exercise Library as Browse Feature**
   - Old: Browse 1000+ exercises
   - New: AI finds exercises for you; search only for specific lookup
   - Keep: API endpoint for AI, search functionality

### Hide / De-emphasize

1. **Detailed Workout Builder**
   - Hide: Full workout creation interface
   - Keep: For AI-generated workouts and power users
   - Access: Through AI Coach or profile settings

2. **Individual Member Profiles in Circle**
   - De-emphasize: Detailed stats about others
   - Focus: Activity (did they train?) not details (what did they lift?)
   - Rationale: Comparison is the thief of joy

3. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - De-emphasize: Charts, graphs, deep analytics
   - Keep: Simple progress indicators
   - Access: In profile for those who want it

### Navigation Changes

**Old Navigation (Tabs):**
1. Home (mixed content)
2. Discover (workout browse)
3. Activity (personal)
4. Circles
5. You (profile)

**New Navigation (Tabs):**
1. **Home** - Circle activity feed (your people)
2. **Circles** - Circle management & details
3. **Log** (+ FAB) - Quick workout logging
4. **Coach** - AI Coach chat
5. **You** - Profile, achievements, goals

---

## Part 4: New User Flow

### Onboarding Transformation

**Old Onboarding Focus:**
- What are your fitness goals?
- What equipment do you have?
- What's your experience level?
- Here are some workouts for you!

**New Onboarding Focus:**
- Who will hold you accountable?
- Join or create a Circle
- Set a goal your Circle will see
- Log your first workout

### Step-by-Step New User Journey

#### Step 1: Welcome & Identity (30 seconds)
- "Welcome to Rallyproof"
- Name, profile photo
- Brief context: "Fitness through accountability"

#### Step 2: The Circle Moment (critical conversion point)
- "You're 3x more likely to succeed with accountability partners"
- Two paths:
  - **"I have people"** -> Enter invite code OR invite via SMS/email
  - **"Find my people"** -> Browse public circles by focus area

#### Step 3: Create or Join Circle
- **Join:** Request to join, wait for approval (or instant if open)
- **Create:** Name your circle, invite 2-5 people
- Must complete this step to continue (circles are not optional)

#### Step 4: Set Your First Goal
- "What do you want to achieve?"
- Simple selection: Get stronger / Lose weight / Build habit / Get active / Sport-specific
- AI generates specific goal suggestions
- Goal is immediately visible to Circle

#### Step 5: Quick Profile (optional, can skip)
- Equipment access
- Limitations (injuries)
- Experience level
- Workout preferences

#### Step 6: First Workout Moment
- "Ready to log your first workout?"
- If yes: Quick log flow
- If no: "No problem. Your Circle will be here when you're ready."
- Either way: Land on Home (Circle feed)

### Key Onboarding Principles

1. **Circle-first:** Cannot complete onboarding without a Circle path
2. **Goal-early:** Set accountability anchor before exploring
3. **Low friction:** Most details can be added later
4. **Social proof:** Show Circle activity to motivate
5. **No content showcase:** Don't show workout library

**Weekly Active Circles:** Number of circles where 50%+ of members logged at least one workout in the past 7 days.

### Primary Metrics

1. **Circle Health**
   - Avg members per circle
   - Circle activity rate (% members logging weekly)
   - Circle retention (30-day, 90-day)

2. **Logging Behavior**

---

## Final Note

This transformation is not about removing features. It's about changing what Rallyproof fundamentally is.

**Old Rallyproof:** "Here are workouts. Pick one."
**New Rallyproof:** "Here are your people. Don't let them down."

The app becomes simpler on the surface but more powerful underneath. Users don't need to think about what workout to do. They need to show up because their Circle is watching, their streak is on the line, and their AI Coach has their back.

**The measure of success:** Users who say "I can't miss today, my Circle is counting on me" not "Let me scroll through some workouts."
